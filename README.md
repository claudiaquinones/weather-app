This web app was created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=204C9yNeOYI&list=WL&index=7&t=0s) to learn how to use APIs in React.
Currently this application provides current weather data and a forecast for a given location.
There are 3 API calls made: 2 to Open Weather Map's API and 1 to MapQuest's GeoCoding API.
